/*
Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.
A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by
deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions
of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Follow up:
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check
one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: falseÂ 

Constraints:
0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 10^4
Both strings consists only of lowercase characters.
